# eduScrumイベント

<!--
Prescribed events are used in eduScrum to create regularity and predictability. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.
-->

事前に決められたイベントは、規則性と予測可能性を作り出すためにeduScrumで使用される。すべてのイベントは、時間に上限のあるタイムボックス化されたイベントである。これは、プロセスでムダなことをせずに、適切な分だけ時間を使うためである。 

<!--
Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to enable critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.
-->

スプリント以外のイベントは、何かを検査・適応するための公式の機会である（スプリントはその他のイベントの入れ物である）。これらのイベントは、重要な透明性や検査が実現できるように設計されている。これらのイベントがなければ、透明性は低下し、検査・適応の多くの機会を失う。

<!--## The Sprint-->
## スプリント

<!--
The heart of eduScrum is a Sprint, 
	a coherent set of learning material that achieves certain learning goals. 
A Sprint can be a context rich lesson series, a project, a chapter from a book, and so on. 
Usually Sprints coincide with semesters or periods, but this is not required.
-->

eduScrumの中心はスプリントである。これは、学習ゴールを達成する学習教材の集合である。コンテキストが豊富な講義シリーズ、プロジェクト、本の章などがスプリントに相当する。通常、スプリントは学期や授業期間と一致するが、必須事項ではない。

<!--
A Sprint has a predetermined time-box, usually two months or less. When this horizon is further away it becomes hard for the Student Teams 
	to plan well and oversee the complexity.
-->
スプリントは事前にタイムボックス化されている。通常、2か月以下のタイムボックスである。これよりも長ければ、学生チームの計画や複雑性の調査が難しくなる。

<!--
The Sprint starts with a 
	Sprint Planning Meeting and Team Formation. The Student Teams determine independently 
		what they will be doing in that period. The Student Team at all times determines the “how”.
-->

スプリントはスプリントプランニングミーティングとチームフォーメーションから始まる。学生チームはスプリントの期間に何をやるかを個別に決める。学生チームは常に「どうやるか」を決めるのである。

<!--Sprints consist of:-->
スプリントは、以下の内容で構成されている。

<!--
•	Sprint Planning meeting including Team Formation
•	Stand Ups at the start of every class
•	performing assignments and tasks within a Sprint
•	Sprint Review
•	Sprint Retrospective and Personal Reflection
-->

* スプリントプランニングミーティング（チームフォーメーションを含む）
* 授業の開始時にスタンドアップ
* スプリントにおける任務とタスクの実行
* スプリントレビュー
* スプリントレトロスペクティブとパーソナルリフレクション

<!--
During the Sprint:
•	the composition of the Student Teams is not changed
•	the scope is not changed; 
		the quality may be clarified and renegotiated 
		between the Product Owner and the Student Team 
		as more is learned
-->
スプリントでは、以下のことを行わない。

* 学生チームの編成は変更しない。
* スコープは変更しない（品質については、プロダクトオーナーと学生チームが協議の上、変更されることもある）。

<!--
The sprint ends with a Review and Retrospective; inspecting work delivered and identifying possibilities for improvement. 
-->
スプリントはレビュー（届けられた成果の検査）とレトロスペクティブ（改善の可能性の特定）で終了する。

<!--
During a Sprint the Product Owner monitors and checks regularly
	whether each Team realizes the intended quality. 
Some teams even have an additional event scheduled on a regular and time-box based interval 
	to secure that Inspection and Adaption takes place 
	during the Sprint. 
Just like in Scrum, in eduScrum we have the motto “Test in the Sprint”. The Product Owner emphasizes regularly 
	that deliveries 
		have to be tested and stimulates the Student Teams to do this themselves.
 Student Teams may think of all kinds of methods to do this, 
 		from testing each other to short educational games or competitions.
-->

スプリントでは、各チームが想定した品質を達成できているかをプロダクトオーナーが定期的に確認する。検査と適応が確実に実施されるように、定期的に追加のイベントを実施したり、タイムボックス化されたインターバルを維持したりするチームもある。スクラムと同様に、eduScrumのモットーは「スプリントのなかでテストする」である。プロダクトオーナーは、成果をテストすべきであることを定期的に強調し、学生チームが自分たちでテストするように促す。学生チームは、お互いにテストしたり、簡単な教育ゲームや競争をしたりするなど、あらゆる手法を考える。

<!--
As Product Owner the teacher monitors the progress of each team. The "Flip" and the Burn Down Charts provide a quick overview.
-->
プロダクトオーナーとして教師は、チームの進捗をモニタリングする。「フリップ」とバーンダウンチャートがあれば、すばやく概要を把握できる。

<!--#### Canceling a Sprint - not in eduScrum.-->
#### スプリントの中止（eduScrumにはない）

<!--
Unlike with Scrum a Sprint cannot be canceled in eduScrum. It is possible that 
	extra assignments (scope) are provided 
	to reach the required results. 
This shall only be used in exceptional circumstances. 
A teacher can also include central explanation moments 
	to ensure the required results. This can be done for all teams or per Student Team.
-->

スクラムとは違い、eduScrumのスプリントは中止できない。求められる結果を達成できるように、任務（スコープ）が追加される可能性もあるが、あくまでも例外的な処置である。教師は学生チームのために説明の時間を確保することもできる。説明はチーム全体に対して行うこともできるし、個別のチームに対して行うこともできる。





<!-- ## The Sprint Planning Meeting-->
## スプリントプランニングミーティング

The Sprint Planning meeting is scheduled at the beginning of the Sprint. It consists of 3 sub elements; Team Formation, Learning Goals and Work Planning. 

<!-- ### Team Formation -->
### チームフォーメーション

In addition to the Scrum Events eduScrum offers two extra events, one of which is Team Formation. Careful Team Formation based on qualities and skills is essential to eduScrum for better learning performance. The work that needs to be done is varied and requires teams to have as many qualities, knowledge and skills as possible.
To achieve good team compositions the following criteria are important: 
	qualities of team members are complementary;
	balanced ratio of sexes;
	different compositions than those during previous assignments;
	composition based on friendship is undesirable.
During Team Formation the Product Owner or the entire class first appoint eduScrum Masters. The eduScrum Masters then choose a team of people with complementary skills. The Team Formation event is part of the Sprint Planning event.

<!-- ### Learning Goals -->
### 学習ゴール

The learning goals give the Student Team the necessary flexibility with respect to what and how there will be delivered within the Sprint. The Product Owner tells what he expects of the Team at the end of the Sprint; the learning goals are primarily subject matter related and are extensions of the Core Goals and Final Terms as formulated by the government.
During their work the Student Team keeps an eye on the learning goals. Assignments and tasks will be done to achieve these learning goals. If the work turns out to be different than the Student Team expected they will work with the Product Owner to restructure the tasks and assignments in such a way that the learning goals can once more be achieved.
The learning goals are part of the formal Core Goals or Final Terms and can as such be seen as milestones in the progress of the Student (Teams).

<!-- ### Work Planning -->
### ワークプランニング

The work that must be done during a Sprint is planned during the Sprint Planning meeting. The creation of this plan is a collaborative effort of the whole Student Team.

First the teacher presents an overview of the assignment, the number of lessons, how many lessons are in a Sprint, when the central moments are, hand in date, evaluation models and so on. The Product Owner sets the boundaries within which the students can claim ownership and create their planning.

The Sprint Planning Meeting is a time box of two classes for a Sprint of approximately two months. This time box is usually also needed for shorter Sprints.

The Sprint Planning Meeting answers the following questions:

	What is expected of the Student Team in this Sprint; what are the learning goals, what teaching material will be covered, what are the acceptance criteria and what dependencies are there.
	What has to be done to achieve the learning goals, in what order and by whom.

The Product Owner presents the learning goals to the Student Teams and explains them so that all Student Teams and all team members have a good idea what is expected of them during this Sprint. The learning goals must have been explained to such a degree that the Student Team can independently elaborate these learning goals in a team planning.

After the Product Owner has explained the learning goals it is up to the Student Team to figure out the required activities. In principle the Student Team is responsible for the size of tasks and partial deliveries.
As soon as it is clear what needs to be done the Student team starts to organize the tasks and partial deliveries chronologically based on their own insight and acceptance criteria of the Product Owner.

As soon as the tasks and partial deliveries have been ordered chronologically the first subdivision into tasks can be done. During this planning session there will only be a first draft. After all, the process of inspection and adaptation continually leads to renewed insights and possibly to changes in the planning and work division.

At the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting the Student Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner how they are planning, as self-organizing team, to achieve the learning goals and how they will realize the Sprint Objectives.


<!-- ## Stand Up -->
## スタンドアップ

The Stand Up is a 5 minute time boxed event for the Student Team to synchronize activities and to make a plan until the next meeting. The Stand Up occurs at the beginning of every class. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Stand up and by forecasting what work can be done until the next Stand Up.

The Stand Up is held every class at the same moment, namely at the beginning, to reduce complexity and introduce regularity. During the Stand Up each Student Team member tells the following:

	What have I done to help the team achieve the Sprint goal since the previous class?
	What will I do this class to help the team achieve the Sprint goal?
	What are impediments that block me or the team to achieve the Sprint goal?

The Student Team uses the Stand Up to evaluate and guard the progress with respect to the learning goals, re-plan the work and to make working agreements. The Stand Up maximizes the likelihood that the Student Team will reach the learning goals at the highest possible quality. The Student Team must be able to explain the Product Owner how they will work together as a self-organizing team to achieve the learning goals and what the activities are in the remainder of the Sprint.

The eduScrum Master makes sure that the Student Team actually does the Stand Up, but the Student Team is responsible for the execution of the Stand Up. The eduScrum Master helps the Student Team to keep the Stand Up within the 5 minute time box.

Stand Ups improve communication, identify and remove obstacles to development, highlight and encourage fast decision making and improve the knowledge of the Student Team about the project. This is a very important “inspect and adapt” meeting.

<!-- ## Sprint Review  -->
## スプリントレビュー

The Sprint Review takes place at the end of Sprint and is synonymous with a final assignment. The Student Teams display what they have learned in the last Sprint, this should be checked against the Learning Goal and Definition of Done. The manner of presentation depends on the Learning Goals and the acceptance criteria. 

During the Sprint it is necessary to Inspect and Adapt as often as possible but without hindering the learning process. In general it can be concluded that the more often Inspection takes place the higher the chances on success are. Frequency of Inspections and how they will be judged should be shared with the Student Team at the start of the Sprint during Sprint Planning. These inspections help the teams to judge what progress and quality are against the Learning Goals, and aim for getting as much feedback as possible about the finished tasks. 

<!-- ## Sprint Retrospective  -->
## スプリントレトロスペクティブ

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Student Team to inspect themselves. The Sprint Retrospective is done as soon as possible after the Sprint Review. The Retrospective should be done thoroughly and is meant for the Team and Individuals to create a plan to improve themselves a and prepare for the upcoming Sprint assignment. This Retrospective should be held as soons as the grades of the final assignment are available. Any delay of the Retrospective is a possible missed opportunity for improvement of the Teams and Indviduals for the current Sprint. 

The goal of this Sprint Retrospective is:

	to inspect how the last Sprint went with respect to people, relations, processes and tools;
	to identify things that went well and potential improvements and to order those; and,
	to create a plan to implement improvements of the way in which the Student Team  
       performs its work.

The Sprint Retrospective consists of three parts:
1.	The students evaluate the methodologies and work methods of the team and identify improvement points;
2.	Next, each student evaluates his team members on skills and improvement points; and he/she does this for him/herself as well;
3.	The team discusses what they should stop doing

Consequently, the students are learning together to learn effectively and efficiently. The Sprint Retrospective is therefore a very important and essential part of the eduScrum process and it must certainly not be omitted. It takes place after the whole Sprint has been finished.

The Student Team individually and collectively answers the following four questions:

1.	What went well?
2.	What can or should be done better?
3.	What should  we not do anymore?
4.	What action will we take into the next Sprint?
