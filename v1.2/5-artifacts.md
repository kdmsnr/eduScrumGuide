<!--# eduScrum Artifacts-->
# eduScrumの作成物

eduScrum’s artifacts represent work or value in various ways that are useful in providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by eduScrum have been specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information needed to ensure Student Teams are successful in achieving a “Done” Learning Goal.

<!-- ## Product Backlog -->
## プロダクトバックログ

The Product Backlog is an ordered list (all items) of learning goals and work methods that conform to the Core Goals as defined by the government for the entire course. 
The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability and ordering.
Contrary to Scrum, where the Product Backlog is never complete, with eduScrum the Core Goals and often the Learning Goals too, are known in advance. The Core Goals are predetermined; the Learning Goals may vary, but are often known as well. However, the work methods will be constantly adjusted based on progressive insight, in accordance with the Scrum principle “Inspect and Adapt”. The Product Backlog is dynamic as to work methods: it constantly changes to identify what the students need to cooperate effectively and to understand the learning material.
The Product Backlog is ordered based on the Learning Program, thus the learning goals and stories (work methods) have to conform to the overall, governmentally imposed Learning Program. The highest ordered Product Backlog items relate to the upcoming Sprint, and lower ordered items will be processed later chronologically. Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. The lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items that will occupy the Student Team for the upcoming Sprint are fine-grained, having been decomposed so that any one item can be “Done” within the Sprint time-box. That is, the learning material has been clarified and outlined sufficiently so that the Student Team will be actually successful in realizing proper results in the upcoming period.

<!-- ## The "Flip" (Scrum Board) -->
## 「フリップ」（スクラムボード）

The “Flip” derives its name from the Flipchart and conveys the mobility of this overview of the set of tasks and assignments (research, quiz, presentation, paper, etc.) that the Student Team will complete in the current Sprint. The Flip is a chronological representation of the Sprint work. The tasks and assignments move according to their status from: To Do, Busy to Done. The Flip is an overview of all tasks needed to accomplish the learning goal. In addition, the Flip provides insight in the Planning. It illustrates exactly where the Student Team stands with respect to done and remaining work. Consequently, the Flip is also a forecast whether the Student Team will achieve the stated learning goals. The Flip must be constantly updated so that it always reflects an “up to date” status of the progress of the Student Team. Updating occurs at least before every Stand Up.

Another attribute of the Flip is that it should enhance the transparency about progress. This requires that the Flip must be visible for all Student Teams during each meeting.

The Flip is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Stand Up. The Student Team modifies the Flip throughout the Sprint, and thus it evolves during the Sprint. So, the Flip may be revised at all times based on progressive insight (such as adding new tasks).

As new work is required, the Student Team adds it to the Flip. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the Student Team can change its Flip during a Sprint. The Flip is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Student Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Student Team.

<!--### Monitoring Sprint Progress -->
### スプリントの進捗のモニタリング

At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint on the Flip can be summed. The Student Team tracks this amount at least for every Stand Up. The Student Team, together with the Product Owner, projects the likelihood of achieving the Learning Goal, based on the status of the remaining tasks. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the Student Team can manage its progress.

<!-- ## Definition of “Done” -->
## 「完成」の定義

When a Learning Goal or a Learning Story item is described as “Done”, everyone must understand what “Done” means. Although this varies significantly per Student Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This “Definition of Done” for the Student Team is used to assess when work is complete for the Learning Goal.

<!-- ### Learning Goal -->
### 学習ゴール

The Learning Goal is the sum of all the items to be completed during a Sprint. At the end of a Sprint, the Learning Goal must be “Done,” which means it must meet the predefined acceptance criteria, where the goal is to get a grade that denotes comprehension of the Learning Goal (which is more or less two thirds of the learning material). Even though a 5.5 (on an scale from 1 – 10) is sufficient to pass to the next Sprint/Period/School Year, that does not by definition indicate comprehension of the Learning Goal. 
The same definition guides the Student Team with planning and decomposing during the Sprint Planning Meeting. The purpose of each Sprint is to accomplish Learning Goals that adhere to the current Definition of “Done” of the Student Team at the highest quality possible.   
Important questions to arrive at a useful Definition of “Done” are:
	How do you check whether you are really done?
	What is done exactly, what criteria should hold?
	But also, when is it not done?

De Student Teams are themselves responsible for setting up their Definition of “Done”. Since setting up a Definition of “Done” is also part of the learning process, it may be changed based on the output of the retrospectives. In that way, new insights can be assimilated into the process to get better results.

<!-- ## The Definition of Fun -->
## 楽しさの定義

An addition to the Definition of “Done” is the Definition of “Fun”. Fun is an important motivator for students and is therefore essential for getting better learning results. Hence, students should also indicate what they need to have fun during the work they are doing. “Need” in this context may be interpreted best in the broad sense of the word: what should be there to ensure enjoyable work. Often the output of a retrospective offers clues for the Definition of “Fun”. The Definition of Fun list is also a ‘living document’ and may be changed or expanded frequently.
