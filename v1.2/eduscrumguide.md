<!--Introduction-->
# イントロダクション

<!-- Most of you reading this paper will not be familiar with Scrum but probably will have a background in education. eduScrum has it origins in both; education and Scrum. Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products. Therefore it is widely used in IT development and about to become mainstream in this area. However, more and more professionals are exploring alternative areas where Scrum can be applied. -->

この論文を読んでいるみなさんは、スクラムのことはご存知ないだろうが、教育については何らかの経験を持ちだろう。eduScrumは「教育」と「スクラム」を起源としている。スクラムとは、持続的で複雑なプロダクトを開発するためのフレームワークである。IT開発の分野では広く使用されており、この分野の主流となりつつある。それでもなお専門家たちは、他にもスクラムを適用できる分野がないかと探し求めている。

<!-- One of these areas is Education. This triggered the eduScrum Team to experiment with this framework in a class-room setting. Although the outcome of school results are relatively easy to predict, the process to achieve these outcomes is a rather complex one as with software development. The pillars Transparency, Inspection and Adaption together with Self-Organizing teams triggered the Team to experiment with this framework. -->
その分野のひとつが「教育」だ。eduScrumチームは、このフレームワークを教室で試してみることにした。学校がもたらす成果については、比較的簡単に予測可能なものだが、その成果に至るまでのプロセスは（ソフトウェア開発と同じように）難しいものである。「透明性」「検査」「適応」の三本柱と「自己組織化」されたチームの理念のもと、このフレームワークを実験することになった。

<!-- For all of you who had a chance to witness what is going on, it is no longer a secret. For those of you who did not have a chance I can assure you that you will be surprised. eduScrum is a cocreative process. Imagine children not being held responsible but feeling responsible for completing work. No one telling the children what and how to do it but only what the expected results are, and they want to do it. Homework is no longer dictated by the teacher, but taken up as deemed appropriate by the students. When you are in a eduScrum class you can feel the energy and positive vibe. -->
その様子を目撃した人たちにとっては、特に目新しいものはないだろう。まだ見たことのない人たちにとっては、これからきっと驚くものが見られるはずだ。eduScrumは共創的なプロセスである。子どもたちが責任を担わされるのではなく、自ら責任を感じて作業を終わらせようとする光景を想像してほしい。子どもたちに何をどうすればいいかを教える者はいない。期待する結果を提示するだけで、子どもたちが自らそれをやりたいと思うのである。宿題を教師が出すことはない。学生が必要だと思うものを自ら選択するのである。eduScrumの教室に入ってみると、エネルギーとポジティブなバイブスが感じられることだろう。

<!-- As Dan Pink points out in his theory, people are no longer motivated by the traditional "Carrot and Stick" method when tasks become more complex, interesting and self-directing. 
This describes our 21st century professionals who are already experiencing that the "carrot and stick" is obsolete. So if we want to prepare our children to become 21st century professionals we will have to give them Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. This is exactly what eduScrum, and the people behind it, will facilitate. -->
ダニエル・ピンクが指摘するように、作業が複雑で、興味深く、自ら決定しなければいけないようなものになれば、伝統的な「アメとムチ」で動機づけされることはない。21世紀の専門家たちは、「アメとムチ」が時代遅れであることをすでに経験しているのである。したがって、子どもたちに21世紀の専門家になってもらいたければ、これから彼らに「自律」「熟達」「目的」を与えなければいけない。これがまさにeduScrum（とそのなかにいる人たち）が促進しようとしていることである。


<!-- This guide contains the minimum set of requirements for successfully working with eduScrum. Any element that could be removed has been removed, but no more than that. Therefore all elements presented in this guide are mandatory for working with eduScrum. If you choose to eliminate certain elements, that's fine. But then it is no longer eduScrum. Adding elements to this framework is very common (and desirable) and as long as the framework is respected this is fine. The framework is lightweight and offers plenty of room for a personal touch.  -->

このガイドには、eduScrumをうまく活用するための最小セットの要求が含まれている。省略可能なものはすでに排除しているが、ごくわずかにすぎない。したがって、eduScrumを活用するには、このガイドにあるすべての要素が必要不可欠となる。特定の要素を排除することも可能だが、それはeduScrumとは言えない。逆に要素を追加するのはよく行われる（望ましい）ことであり、このフレームワークを尊重している限り、認められている。このフレームワークは軽量級であり、自由にカスタマイズできるようになっている。



<!-- # Purpose of the eduScrum Guide-->
# eduScrumガイドの目的

<!-- eduScrum is based on Scrum (a framework for developing and sustaining complex products - Jeff Sutherland & Ken Schwaber 2013). -->

eduScrumは、スクラム（複雑なプロダクトの開発および維持のためのフレームワーク - Jeff Sutherland & Ken Schwaber 2013）にもとづいている。

<!-- eduScrum is a framework for coaching students where the responsibility for the learning process is delegated from teachers to students. -->

eduScrumは、学習プロセスの責任が教師から学生へ委譲された状況において、学生をコーチングするためのフレームワークである。

<!-- This Guide contains the definition of eduScrum. This includes the eduScrum roles, events, artifacts and the rules that bind them together. This Guide was inspired by the original Scrum Guide by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber.  -->
このガイドには、eduScrumの定義が含まれている。eduScrumの定義には、eduScrumの役割・イベント・作成物と、それらをまとめるルールが含まれる。このガイドは、ジェフ・サザーランドとケン・シュエイバーによる本家の「スクラムガイド」に影響を受けている。

<!-- In eduScrum learning takes center stage; learn smarter, improve collaboration and get to know yourself better. 
This way of working also creates more responsibility, fun and energy that lead to better results and shorter turnaround times. 
Because of this 
students experience strong personal growth that strengthens their confidence in themselves and others. 
The key to all this is ownership; the students have the freedom to determine their own learning process within given boundaries and learning goals. eduScrum does not only improve study results but also improves personal development and collaboration within a team. -->

eduScrumでは、学習が主役である。賢く学習して、みんなとうまく協調して、自分のことをもっとよく知る。それにより、責任感や楽しさやエネルギーが増し、短い期間でよりよい結果が生まれるようになる。そして、学生たちは自分や他人に対する自信を持ち、個人の大きな成長を経験するのである。ここで重要となるのが「当事者意識」だ。つまり、学生たちは与えられた境界線と学習ゴールのなかで、自分たちの学習プロセスを自分たちで決定する自由を持っている。eduScrumは学習成果を改善するだけでなく、個人の成長やチームの協調についても改善するのである。


<!-- # Definition of eduScrum-->
# eduScrumの定義

<!-- eduScrum: A framework within which students can tackle complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively achieving learning goals and personal growth of the highest possible value. eduScrum is: -->

eduScrumは、学生たちが複雑適応系の問題に対応するためのフレームワークであり、可能な限り価値の高い学習ゴールと個人の成長を生産的かつ創造的に達成するためのものである。

eduScrumとは、以下のようなものである。

<!--
	Lightweight
	Easy to understand
	Difficult to master (because the Student Teams have to do it themselves).
-->

* 軽量
* 理解が容易
* 習得は困難（学生チームが自ら行わなければいけないから）

<!-- The last because eduScrum only prescribes the "What" and not the "How". eduScrum is not a process or technique for coaching students; it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. 
eduScrum provides transparency on effectiveness of plans and the chosen approach so students can improve themselves. 
eduScrum challenges students on self-organization and quality of work within a given time frame with clear learning goals. 
-->

最後の「習得は困難」は、eduScrumが「何をするか」だけを規定しており、「どうやるか」については触れていないためである。eduScrumは、学生をコーチングするためのプロセスや技法ではなく、さまざまなプロセスや技法を取り入れることのできるフレームワークである。eduScrumは、計画ならびに選択した手法の効果に対する透明性を提供するため、学生たちは自ら改善していくことができる。eduScrumは、学生たちに自己組織化および決められた時間内に明確な学習ゴールと成果を成し遂げることを求めている。


<!-- With eduScrum quality (with respect to subject matter, collaboration and personal development) is constantly evolving during the school year. Students co-determine their own quality of work as a result of ownership. Ownership combined with continuous improvement leads to higher quality. In a Review the focus is on the "What" (subject matter). The Retrospective is about the “How” (collaboration, using personal qualities, personal development).-->

eduScrumを使えば（成果、協力、個人の成長などに関する）品質が、その学年のなかで常に進化していく。学生は、当事者意識を持っているため、みんなで一緒に自分たちの品質を決定する。当事者意識と継続的改善を組み合わせれば、高品質につながる。レビューでは、「何をしたか」（成果）にフォーカスする。レトロスペクティブでは、「どうやったか」（協力、個性の活用、個人の成長）を扱う。



<!--# eduScrum Framework-->
# eduScrumフレームワーク

<!-- The eduScrum framework, like the Scrum framework, consists of Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts and rules. 
Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to eduScrum's success and usage.  -->

eduScrumフレームワークは、スクラムフレームワークと同様に、チームとその役割・イベント・作成物・ルールで構成されている。それぞれに目的があり、eduScrumの成功や利用に欠かせない。

<!-- Specific implementation strategies of eduScrum may vary and are not a part of this Guide. -->

eduScrumを使用する戦略にはさまざまなものがあり、それらについてはこのガイドでは触れない。

<!--The rules of eduScrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the relationships and interaction between them. The rules of eduScrum are described throughout the body of this document.-->

eduScrumのルールは、役割・イベント・作成物をまとめ、それらの関係性や相互作用を統括するものである。eduScrumのルールについては、本稿全体で説明する。


<!-- # eduScrum Theory -->
# eduScrumの理論

<!-- eduScrum, like Scrum, is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. eduScrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize the achievability of learning goals and control risk.-->

eduScrumは、スクラムと同様に、経験的プロセス制御の理論（経験主義）を基本にしている。経験主義とは、実際の経験と既知にもとづく判断によって知識が獲得できるというものである。eduScrumでは、反復的かつ漸進的な手法を用いて、学習ゴールの達成可能性の最適化とリスクの管理を行う。 

<!-- Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.-->

経験的プロセス制御の実現は、透明性・検査・適応の3本柱に支えられている。

<!-- ## Transparency-->
## 透明性
<!-- Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. Transparency requires those aspects to be defined by a common standard so observers share a common understanding of what is being seen. For example: -->
経験的プロセスで重要なのは、
成果に対する責任が見える化されていることである。
透明性とは、こうしたことが標準化され、見ている人たちが共通理解を持つことである。

例：

<!-- A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants; and, 
	Those performing the work and those accepting the work product must share a common definition of "Done".-->

* プロセスの用語を参加者全員で共有している。
* 作業をする人とその成果を受け取る人が「完成」の定義を共有している。

<!-- eduScrum focuses on adding value, where value is the sum of individual learning results, personal development and cooperative achievements. 
The eduScrum framework is meant to provide transparency on the above to support the learning process. 
Transparency is necessary to help students make the right decisions in their learning process so they are able to maximize value. -->
eduScrumは、価値を高めることにフォーカスしている。価値とは、個人の学習結果、個人の成長、みんなの協力を合わせたものである。eduScrumフレームワークは、学習プロセスを支援する上記の透明性を提供するものである。透明性は、学生が学習プロセスにおいて適切な決定を行い、価値を最大化するために必要なものである。


<!-- ## Inspection-->
## 検査

<!--eduScrum users must frequently inspect eduScrum artifacts and progress toward Learning Goals to detect undesirable deviations. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by both teachers and students, at the location of the work itself (the classroom or practice area).-->

eduScrumのユーザーは、eduScrumの作成物や学習ゴールに対する進捗を頻繁に検査し、好ましくない逸脱を検知する。ただし、検査を頻繁にやりすぎて作業の妨げになってはいけない。作業が行われる場所（教室や練習場）で教師と学生の両方が念入りに行えば、検査は最大の効果をもたらす。


<!-- ## Adaptation-->
## 適応

<!-- If a student (or teacher) determines that one or more aspects of a process threaten to deviate outside acceptable limits and/or that the results will be unacceptable, the planning or approach must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.-->

プロセスの不備が許容値を超え、成果を受け入れられないと学生（もしくは教師）が判断した場合は、計画や手法を調整する必要がある。調整はできるだけ早く行い、これ以上の逸脱を防がなければいけない。


<!-- eduScrum prescribes six formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in this eduScrum Events section of this document: -->

eduScrumスクラムでは、検査と適応を行う6つのイベントを規定している。詳しくは「eduScrumイベント」の節で説明する。

<!--
•	Team Formation
•	Sprint Planning
•	Standup (at the beginning of each class)
•	Sprint Review (test, oral or written presentation, experiment or a combination) 
•	Sprint Retrospective (functioning of team and team members)
•	Personal Reflection (personal)
-->

* チームフォーメーション
* スプリントプランニング
* スタンドアップ（授業の開始時）
* スプリントレビュー（テスト、プレゼン、実験、以上の組み合わせ）
* スプリントレトロスペクティブ（チームおよびチームメンバーのため）
* パーソナルリフレクション（個人のため）

<!-- # An eduScrum Team-->
# eduScrumチーム

<!-- An eduScrum Team consists of a teacher (Product Owner) and Student Teams of four students. One of the four students of a Team fills the role of (Student Team) eduScrum Master. 
Student Teams are self-organizing and multi-disciplinary. 
Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team (e.g. teachers). 
Multi-disciplinary teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work. 
The students form themselves into Student Teams 
	based on skills and personal qualities. 
Although the team is responsible for its own results and is in that sense independent, they may use insights and information of other teams. 
Cross-team cooperation is encouraged.  The team model in eduScrum is designed for optimal autonomy, collaboration, flexibility, creativity, motivation and productivity.-->

eduScrumチームは、教師（プロダクトオーナー）と4人の学生チームで構成される。4人のうち1人が（学生チームの）eduScrumマスターの役割を担う。学生チームは自己組織化されており、多様な専門分野を持っている。学生チームは、作業を成し遂げるための最善の策を、チーム外（教師）からの指示ではなく、自分たちで選択する。多様な専門分野を持つチームは、作業を成し遂げるすべての能力を持っている。学生たちはスキルや個性にもとづいて、自分たちで学生チームを作る。チームは結果に責任を持っているので、その意味では独立しているのだが、他のチームの知見や情報を使うこともできる。チームを横断した協力が推奨されている。eduScrumにおけるチームのモデルは、自律性・協力・柔軟性・創造性・動機・生産性を最適化するように設計されている。 


<!-- eduScrum Teams deliver learning results iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback and adjustment. 
Incremental deliveries of “Done” learning results 
ensure that a potentially good result towards the learning goals is always achievable.-->

eduScrumチームは、学習結果を反復的・漸進的に届ける。これは、フィードバックと調整の機会を最大化するためである。「完成」した学習結果を漸進的に届けることで、学習ゴールを目指した成果に常に手が届くようにしておく。

<!--## The Product Owner-->
## プロダクトオーナー

<!--
The Product Owner determines learning objectives and is also responsible for monitoring and grading results. 
He or she will also facilitate the eduScrum process and the personal and team development process. 
The Product Owner may do so 
	by reference to learning materials, answering questions and providing examples. 
Encouraging cooperation between teams is also one of the key responsibilities of the Product Owner. 
How organizations, teams and individuals try to accomplish this 
	depends on organizational approach and strategy. 
-->

プロダクトオーナーは、学習目的を設定する。また、結果のモニタリングと成績評価を行う責任がある。学習教材を参照したり、質問に答えたり、例を示したりして、eduScrumのプロセスと個人およびチームの開発プロセスをファシリテートする。チームを横断した協力を促すこともプロダクトオーナーの重要な責任のひとつである。組織・チーム・個人がこれをどのように達成するかは、組織の手法や戦略によって決まる。

<!--
As Product Owner the Teacher explicitly focuses on the subject matter. The Product Owner is responsible for:
-->
教師はプロダクトオーナーとして、明確に成果にフォーカスする。
プロダクトオーナーの責任は以下である。

<!--
1.	determining WHAT needs to be learned;
2.	monitoring and improving the quality of educational results;
3.	evaluating and judging the educational results (based on the Definition of Done and acceptance criteria)
-->

1. 「何を」学習するかを決定
2. 教育結果の「品質」のモニタリングと向上
3. 教育結果の「評価」と「判断」（完成の定義と受け入れ基準にもとづく）

<!--### 1. Determining WHAT needs to be learned-->
### 1. 「何を」学習するかを決定

<!--
The Product Owner is responsible for the measurable results of education: test results, passing to the next grade, and final exam results. The Product Owner ensures that the various stakeholders, such as students, parents, management and government are satisfied with educational results.-->
プロダクトオーナーは、テスト結果、進級★、最終試験の結果などの計測可能な教育結果に対して責任を持つ。プロダクトオーナーは、さまざまなステークホルダー（学生、親、マネジメント、政府）が教育結果に満足しなければいけない。

<!--
Therefore the responsibility of WHAT needs to be learned and what has priority for a specific subject lies with the Product Owner. 
To monitor and evaluate progress and results 
	the Product Owner will define acceptance criteria (such as criteria for grading, presentation guidelines, etc.) prior to a period. 
-->
したがって、「何を」の責任を獲得する必要がある。
また、特定のテーマの優先度を決めるのはプロダクトオーナーの責任である。
進捗や結果のモニタリングや評価のために、
プロダクトオーナーは事前に受け入れ基準
（成績基準やプレゼンテーションのガイドラインなど）を決定する。


<!-- ### 2. Monitoring and improving the quality of the educational results -->
### 2. 教育結果の「品質」のモニタリングと向上


<!-- Together with determining what needs to be learned, the Product Owner must also monitor, check and improve the quality of the educational results. 
To do this, the Product Owner uses two benchmarks: the Definition of Done, defined by the Student Team, and the acceptance criteria defined by the Product Owner.
-->

学習すべきことの決定と一緒に、
プロダクトオーナーは
教育結果の品質のモニタリング、チェック、改善を行わなければいけない。
そのためには、
プロダクトオーナーは2つのベンチマークを使用する。
学生チームが定義する「完成の定義」と
プロダクトオーナーが定義する「受け入れ基準」だ。

<!-- Acceptance Criteria -->
#### 受け入れ基準

<!--
To monitor the quality of what has been learned, the Product Owner defines a number of acceptance criteria that are determined beforehand and are shared with the Student Teams.
For example, these Acceptance Criteria consist of the minimum test scores, types and size of presentations, deadlines and other requirements on the results. 
The Student Team is responsible for complying with the Acceptance Criteria. 
The team members themselves define tasks and activities to ensure that they will comply with the Acceptance Criteria.
-->

何を学習したかの品質をモニタリングするには、
プロダクトオーナーが複数の受け入れ基準を事前に定義して、
学生チームと共有する。
たとえば、受け入れ基準には、
テストの最低合格点、
プレゼンテーションの種類と規模、
結果の締め切りなどの要件が含まれる。
学生チームは受け入れ基準を満たす責任がある。
チームメンバーは受け入れ基準を満たすために必要な作業や活動を自分たちで定義する。

<!-- Definition of Done (DoD) -->
#### 完成の定義（DoD）

<!--
To guard the quality of the Learning Goals the Student Team defines a Definition of Done. 
Prior to a Sprint the Student Team determines when their work is “Done”. 
With inexperienced Teams this is done in consultation with the Product Owner. 
Experienced teams do this autonomously. 
This way the Student Teams keep getting better in defining their own quality criteria.
-->
学習ゴールの品質を守るには、
学生チームが「完成の定義」を定義する。
スプリントの前に学生チームが、いつ作業が「完成」するかを決める。
未経験のチームはプロダクトオーナーと相談して決める。
経験のあるチームは自発的に決める。
このようにして学生チームは自分たちの品質基準の定義を改善していくのである。

<!-- ### 3. Evaluating the educational results -->
### 3. 教育結果の「評価」と「判断」

<!--
The Product Owner evaluates - in name of the stakeholders (parents, school board and students) - the quality of the educational results. 
The Product Owner evaluates and judges 
	both the individual students (with for instance a written test) and the teams (by evaluating an end product of the team).
-->
プロダクトオーナーは
ステークホルダー（両親、教育委員会、生徒）の代表として教育結果の品質を評価する。
プロダクトオーナーは
生徒個人
と
チームの両方を評価する（それぞれ筆記テストとチームのプロダクト評価などを使う）。

<!--
The Product Owner is the only person who is responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management consists of:
-->
プロダクトオーナーは
プロダクトバックログを管理する唯一の責任者である。
プロダクトバックログの管理は以下である。★

<!--
	Initial explanation of eduScrum to the Students (one time - 2 hours),
	Define Sprint Goal, meaning learning goals for that Sprint,
	Define and explain the Acceptance Criteria. Clearly explain what the criteria are that determine 
		if a learning goal has been achieved 
		so that the teams can start working independently 
		(experiments, papers, presentations, etc.),
	Facilitating the Student Team; 
			next to clear learning goals and acceptance Criteria also refers to teaching and background material and is available for questions.
	Monitors that all involved will follow the eduScrum process.  
-->

* eduScrumについて生徒に最初に説明する（1回、2時間）
* スプリントゴールの定義（今回のスプリントの学習ゴール）
* 受け入れ基準の定義と説明★
* 学生チームのファシリテーション
* 

Unlike in Scrum the eduScrum Product Owner is not bound to a team but to a subject. 
The Product Owner therefore supports multiple teams across multiple classes. With cross-subject Teams can even have multiple Product Owners, one per subject.

eduScrumのプロダクトオーナーはスクラムとは違い、
チームではなく教科に結び付いている。
したがって、プロダクトオーナーは複数のクラスの複数のチームをサポートする。
複数の教科を受け持つチームは、
教科ごとに複数のプロダクトオーナーを持つこともある。

Sometimes students have the freedom within the curriculum of the school to partly determine their own learning goals. 
In this case the Product Owner is still responsible for the final acceptance criteria, but the relation with core goals and final terms is much more relaxed. 
生徒は学校のカリキュラムのなかで、
自分たちの学習ゴールをある程度は自由に決めることができる。★。
その場合も、プロダクトオーナーが最終的な受け入れ基準に責任を持つ。
だが、
中心的なゴールと最終的な条件★の関係★はもっとゆるい。

As product owner the teacher is a servant leader to the Student Teams. The product owner is also responsible for the propagation of the eduScrum philosophy. The product owner is responsible that eduScrum is understood and correctly executed and therefore focuses on the way of working and collaboration of all Student Teams of a class. To ensure this, the product owner, does the following:

プロダクトオーナーとして教師は、
学生チームのサーバントリーダーである。
プロダクトオーナーは

	explain what eduScrum is, what its relevance is and how it works (one time)
	ensure that good Student Teams are formed based on complementary skills
	ensure that the eduScrum process is followed by holding a Student Team to the eduScrum theory and rules
	if necessary intervene with extra explanation, demonstrations, positive feedback etc.
	encourage energy, fun and a growth mindset (may be delegated to eduScrum Master)
	protect teams from interruptions from outside (may be delegated to eduScrum Master)
	encourage Student Teams to remove impediments quickly and autonomously; impediments that are too large for a Team should quickly be resolved by the product owner. (may be delegated to eduScrum Master)

Furthermore the product owner is responsible for coaching and guiding the students who serve as eduScrum Masters within their Student Team. (see eduScrum Master)
The product owner also encourages cross-Team collaboration. After all, Student Teams can learn a lot from each other’s successes and failures.

<!-- ## The Student Team -->
## 学生チーム

The Student Team consists of autonomous students who collaborate to achieve the required learning goals at the end of the Sprint according to the defined acceptance criteria. 
The team members are responsible together, as a team, for complying with the acceptance criteria.

学生チームは
求められる学習ゴールを
スプリントの終わりまでに協力して達成する自主的な学生で構成されている。
決められた受け入れ基準を満たしながら。
チームメンバーは
一緒にチームとして受け入れ基準を満たす責任がある。


The Student Teams are structured and empowered by the Product Owner in such a way that they can organize and manage their own work. Because of this the effectiveness and efficiency is greatly improved, and also the learning experience and personal growth.

Student Teams have the following characteristics:

1.	They are self-organizing. Nobody (not even the Product Owner) tells the Student Team how they should realize the learning goals.
2.	They are multi-disciplinary, with all required skills and personal development themes to be able to achieve the learning goals together and can develop personally.
3.	Student Team members can have specific skills or focus areas, but the responsibility lies with the Student Team as a whole,
4.	The Student Team members may determine themselves if they want to contribute their qualities, or that they want to develop new areas.
5.	The Student Team tracks its own progress and quality level based on the acceptance criteria and the Definition of Done. 

<!-- ### Student Team size -->
### 学生チームの規模

The optimum Student Team size is small enough to be manageable and large enough to perform significant amounts of work. A rule of thumb is to have 4 person teams. Less than three members leads to less interaction and representation of skills. More than five members in the team requires too much coordination. Large teams generate too much complexity to be able to be controlled by an empirical process. The teacher is not counted in the Student Team size.

<!-- ## The eduScrum Master -->
## eduScrumマスター

Within a Student Team one of the members performs the eduScrum Master role of that team. The eduScrum Master is a “serving, coaching leader” of the team while they are also part of the team. They help their team to perform optimally - but they do not direct the team.
Within eduScrum the eduScrum Master has a more constrained role than the Scrum Master role in Scrum. This is because the Product Owner takes on several of these responsibilities. As the eduScrum Masters gain more experience, they take up more responsibilities and the number of responsibilities of the Product Owner decreases more and more.
In the Team Formation ceremony first the eduScrum Masters are chosen by the Product Owner or by the class. The eduScrum Masters in turn choose team members with complementary skills.
In the Student Team the eduScrum Master is responsible for the "Flip" (a synonym for the Scrum Board - one sheet of flipchart paper). The eduScrum Master ensures that the "Flip" is available and up to date. However, performing the actual work is the responsibility of the whole team. The eduScrum Master also supports the Product Owner and the Student Team.
The eduScrum Master role is by default the responsibility of the Product Owner. However the better teams get, the more responsibilities are delegated to the eduScrum Master on the Team.

<!-- ### eduScrum Master service to the Product Owner -->
### eduScrumマスター★

The eduScrum Master serves the Product Owner in various ways, including:
	creating transparency on progress by making the "Flip" available and ensuring that it is up to date
	facilitating eduScrum events when asked or needed.

<!-- ### eduScrum Master service to the Student Team -->

The eduScrum Master serves the Student Team in several ways, including at the very least:
	creating transparency on progress by making the Flip" available and ensuring that it is up to date
	ensuring correct execution of eduScrum (initiating and facilitating eduScrum events, correct execution of events, use instruments correctly)
	facilitating cross-team collaboration

<!--# eduScrum Events-->
# eduScrumイベント

<!--
Prescribed events are used in eduScrum to create regularity and predictability. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.
-->

事前に決められたイベントは、規則性と予測可能性を作り出すためにeduScrumで使用される。すべてのイベントは、時間に上限のあるタイムボックス化されたイベントである。これは、プロセスでムダなことをせずに、適切な分だけ時間を使うためである。 

<!--
Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to enable critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.
-->

スプリント以外のイベントは、何かを検査・適応するための公式の機会である（スプリントはその他のイベントの入れ物である）。これらのイベントは、重要な透明性や検査が実現できるように設計されている。これらのイベントがなければ、透明性は低下し、検査・適応の多くの機会を失う。

<!--## The Sprint-->
## スプリント

The heart of eduScrum is a Sprint, a coherent set of learning material that achieves certain learning goals. 
A Sprint can be a context rich lesson serie, a project, a chapter from a book, and so on. 
Usually Sprints coincide with semesters or periods, but this is not required.

eduScrumの中心はスプリントである。
これは学習ゴールを達成する学習教材のまとまりだ。
スプリントは、
コンテキストリッチなレッスンシリーズ、プロジェクト、本の章などである★。
通常、スプリントは学期や授業期間と一致する。だが、これは必須ではない。

A Sprint has a predetermined time-box, usually two months or less. When this horizon is further away it becomes hard for the Student Teams 
	to plan well and oversee the complexity.
スプリントは事前にタイムボックス化されている。
通常、2か月以下のタイムボックスである。
これよりも長ければ、学生チームの計画や複雑性の調査が難しくなる。★

The Sprint starts with a Sprint Planning Meeting and Team Formation. The Student Teams determine independently what they will be doing in that period. The Student Team at all times determines the “how”.
スプリントはスプリントプランニングミーティングとチームフォーメーションから開始する。
学生チームは


Sprints consist of:
•	Sprint Planning meeting including Team Formation
•	Stand Ups at the start of every class
•	performing assignments and tasks within a Sprint
•	Sprint Review
•	Sprint Retrospective and Personal Reflection
During the Sprint:
•	the composition of the Student Teams is not changed
•	the scope is not changed; the quality may be clarified and renegotiated between the Product Owner and the Student Team as more is learned
The sprint ends with a Review and Retrospective; inspecting work delivered and identifying possibilities for improvement. 

During a Sprint the Product Owner monitors and checks regularly whether each Team realizes the intended quality. Some teams even have an additional event scheduled on a regular and time-box based interval to secure that Inspection and Adaption takes place during the Sprint. Just like in Scrum, in eduScrum we have the motto “Test in the Sprint”. The Product Owner emphasizes regularly that deliveries have to be tested and stimulates the Student Teams to do this themselves. Student Teams may think of all kinds of methods to do this, from testing each other to short educational games or competitions.
As Product Owner the teacher monitors the progress of each team. The "Flip" and the Burn Down Charts provide a quick overview.

<!--#### Canceling a Sprint - not in eduScrum.-->
#### スプリントの中止（eduScrumにはない）

Unlike with Scrum a Sprint cannot be canceled in eduScrum. It is possible that extra assignments (scope) are provided to reach the required results. This shall only be used in exceptional circumstances. A teacher can also include central explanation moments to ensure the required results. This can be done for all teams or per Student Team.

<!-- ## The Sprint Planning Meeting-->
## スプリントプランニングミーティング

The Sprint Planning meeting is scheduled at the beginning of the Sprint. It consists of 3 sub elements; Team Formation, Learning Goals and Work Planning. 

<!-- ### Team Formation -->
### チームフォーメーション

In addition to the Scrum Events eduScrum offers two extra events, one of which is Team Formation. Careful Team Formation based on qualities and skills is essential to eduScrum for better learning performance. The work that needs to be done is varied and requires teams to have as many qualities, knowledge and skills as possible.
To achieve good team compositions the following criteria are important: 
	qualities of team members are complementary;
	balanced ratio of sexes;
	different compositions than those during previous assignments;
	composition based on friendship is undesirable.
During Team Formation the Product Owner or the entire class first appoint eduScrum Masters. The eduScrum Masters then choose a team of people with complementary skills. The Team Formation event is part of the Sprint Planning event.

<!-- ### Learning Goals -->
### 学習ゴール

The learning goals give the Student Team the necessary flexibility with respect to what and how there will be delivered within the Sprint. The Product Owner tells what he expects of the Team at the end of the Sprint; the learning goals are primarily subject matter related and are extensions of the Core Goals and Final Terms as formulated by the government.
During their work the Student Team keeps an eye on the learning goals. Assignments and tasks will be done to achieve these learning goals. If the work turns out to be different than the Student Team expected they will work with the Product Owner to restructure the tasks and assignments in such a way that the learning goals can once more be achieved.
The learning goals are part of the formal Core Goals or Final Terms and can as such be seen as milestones in the progress of the Student (Teams).

<!-- ### Work Planning -->
### ワークプランニング

The work that must be done during a Sprint is planned during the Sprint Planning meeting. The creation of this plan is a collaborative effort of the whole Student Team.

First the teacher presents an overview of the assignment, the number of lessons, how many lessons are in a Sprint, when the central moments are, hand in date, evaluation models and so on. The Product Owner sets the boundaries within which the students can claim ownership and create their planning.

The Sprint Planning Meeting is a time box of two classes for a Sprint of approximately two months. This time box is usually also needed for shorter Sprints.

The Sprint Planning Meeting answers the following questions:

	What is expected of the Student Team in this Sprint; what are the learning goals, what teaching material will be covered, what are the acceptance criteria and what dependencies are there.
	What has to be done to achieve the learning goals, in what order and by whom.

The Product Owner presents the learning goals to the Student Teams and explains them so that all Student Teams and all team members have a good idea what is expected of them during this Sprint. The learning goals must have been explained to such a degree that the Student Team can independently elaborate these learning goals in a team planning.

After the Product Owner has explained the learning goals it is up to the Student Team to figure out the required activities. In principle the Student Team is responsible for the size of tasks and partial deliveries.
As soon as it is clear what needs to be done the Student team starts to organize the tasks and partial deliveries chronologically based on their own insight and acceptance criteria of the Product Owner.

As soon as the tasks and partial deliveries have been ordered chronologically the first subdivision into tasks can be done. During this planning session there will only be a first draft. After all, the process of inspection and adaptation continually leads to renewed insights and possibly to changes in the planning and work division.

At the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting the Student Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner how they are planning, as self-organizing team, to achieve the learning goals and how they will realize the Sprint Objectives.


<!-- ## Stand Up -->
## スタンドアップ

The Stand Up is a 5 minute time boxed event for the Student Team to synchronize activities and to make a plan until the next meeting. The Stand Up occurs at the beginning of every class. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Stand up and by forecasting what work can be done until the next Stand Up.
The Stand Up is held every class at the same moment, namely at the beginning, to reduce complexity and introduce regularity. During the Stand Up each Student Team member tells the following:
	What have I done to help the team achieve the Sprint goal since the previous class?
	What will I do this class to help the team achieve the Sprint goal?
	What are impediments that block me or the team to achieve the Sprint goal?

The Student Team uses the Stand Up to evaluate and guard the progress with respect to the learning goals, re-plan the work and to make working agreements. The Stand Up maximizes the likelihood that the Student Team will reach the learning goals at the highest possible quality. The Student Team must be able to explain the Product Owner how they will work together as a self-organizing team to achieve the learning goals and what the activities are in the remainder of the Sprint.
The eduScrum Master makes sure that the Student Team actually does the Stand Up, but the Student Team is responsible for the execution of the Stand Up. The eduScrum Master helps the Student Team to keep the Stand Up within the 5 minute time box.
Stand Ups improve communication, identify and remove obstacles to development, highlight and encourage fast decision making and improve the knowledge of the Student Team about the project. This is a very important “inspect and adapt” meeting.

<!-- ## Sprint Review  -->
## スプリントレビュー

The Sprint Review takes place at the end of Sprint and is synonymous with a final assignment. The Student Teams display what they have learned in the last Sprint, this should be checked against the Learning Goal and Definition of Done. The manner of presentation depends on the Learning Goals and the acceptance criteria. 
During the Sprint it is necessary to Inspect and Adapt as often as possible but without hindering the learning process. In general it can be concluded that the more often Inspection takes place the higher the chances on success are. Frequency of Inspections and how they will be judged should be shared with the Student Team at the start of the Sprint during Sprint Planning. These inspections help the teams to judge what progress and quality are against the Learning Goals, and aim for getting as much feedback as possible about the finished tasks. 

<!-- ## Sprint Retrospective  -->
## スプリントレトロスペクティブ

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Student Team to inspect themselves. The Sprint Retrospective is done as soon as possible after the Sprint Review. The Retrospective should be done thoroughly and is meant for the Team and Individuals to create a plan to improve themselves a and prepare for the upcoming Sprint assignment. This Retrospective should be held as soons as the grades of the final assignment are available. Any delay of the Retrospective is a possible missed opportunity for improvement of the Teams and Indviduals for the current Sprint. 
The goal of this Sprint Retrospective is:
	to inspect how the last Sprint went with respect to people, relations, processes and tools;
	to identify things that went well and potential improvements and to order those; and,
	to create a plan to implement improvements of the way in which the Student Team  
       performs its work.

The Sprint Retrospective consists of three parts:
1.	The students evaluate the methodologies and work methods of the team and identify improvement points;
2.	Next, each student evaluates his team members on skills and improvement points; and he/she does this for him/herself as well;
3.	The team discusses what they should stop doing

Consequently, the students are learning together to learn effectively and efficiently. The Sprint Retrospective is therefore a very important and essential part of the eduScrum process and it must certainly not be omitted. It takes place after the whole Sprint has been finished.
The Student Team individually and collectively answers the following four questions:
1.	What went well?
2.	What can or should be done better?
3.	What should  we not do anymore?
4.	What action will we take into the next Sprint?

<!--# eduScrum Artifacts-->
# eduScrumの作成物

eduScrum’s artifacts represent work or value in various ways that are useful in providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by eduScrum have been specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information needed to ensure Student Teams are successful in achieving a “Done” Learning Goal.

<!-- ## Product Backlog -->
## プロダクトバックログ

The Product Backlog is an ordered list (all items) of learning goals and work methods that conform to the Core Goals as defined by the government for the entire course. 
The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability and ordering.
Contrary to Scrum, where the Product Backlog is never complete, with eduScrum the Core Goals and often the Learning Goals too, are known in advance. The Core Goals are predetermined; the Learning Goals may vary, but are often known as well. However, the work methods will be constantly adjusted based on progressive insight, in accordance with the Scrum principle “Inspect and Adapt”. The Product Backlog is dynamic as to work methods: it constantly changes to identify what the students need to cooperate effectively and to understand the learning material.
The Product Backlog is ordered based on the Learning Program, thus the learning goals and stories (work methods) have to conform to the overall, governmentally imposed Learning Program. The highest ordered Product Backlog items relate to the upcoming Sprint, and lower ordered items will be processed later chronologically. Higher ordered Product Backlog items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. The lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items that will occupy the Student Team for the upcoming Sprint are fine-grained, having been decomposed so that any one item can be “Done” within the Sprint time-box. That is, the learning material has been clarified and outlined sufficiently so that the Student Team will be actually successful in realizing proper results in the upcoming period.

<!-- ## The "Flip" (Scrum Board) -->
## 貼りもの（スクラムボード）

The “Flip” derives its name from the Flipchart and conveys the mobility of this overview of the set of tasks and assignments (research, quiz, presentation, paper, etc.) that the Student Team will complete in the current Sprint. The Flip is a chronological representation of the Sprint work. The tasks and assignments move according to their status from: To Do, Busy to Done. The Flip is an overview of all tasks needed to accomplish the learning goal. In addition, the Flip provides insight in the Planning. It illustrates exactly where the Student Team stands with respect to done and remaining work. Consequently, the Flip is also a forecast whether the Student Team will achieve the stated learning goals. The Flip must be constantly updated so that it always reflects an “up to date” status of the progress of the Student Team. Updating occurs at least before every Stand Up.

Another attribute of the Flip is that it should enhance the transparency about progress. This requires that the Flip must be visible for all Student Teams during each meeting.

The Flip is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Stand Up. The Student Team modifies the Flip throughout the Sprint, and thus it evolves during the Sprint. So, the Flip may be revised at all times based on progressive insight (such as adding new tasks).

As new work is required, the Student Team adds it to the Flip. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the Student Team can change its Flip during a Sprint. The Flip is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Student Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Student Team.

<!--### Monitoring Sprint Progress -->
### スプリントの進捗のモニタリング

At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint on the Flip can be summed. The Student Team tracks this amount at least for every Stand Up. The Student Team, together with the Product Owner, projects the likelihood of achieving the Learning Goal, based on the status of the remaining tasks. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the Student Team can manage its progress.

<!-- ## Definition of “Done” -->
## 「完成」の定義

When a Learning Goal or a Learning Story item is described as “Done”, everyone must understand what “Done” means. Although this varies significantly per Student Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This “Definition of Done” for the Student Team is used to assess when work is complete for the Learning Goal.

<!-- ### Learning Goal -->
### 学習ゴール

The Learning Goal is the sum of all the items to be completed during a Sprint. At the end of a Sprint, the Learning Goal must be “Done,” which means it must meet the predefined acceptance criteria, where the goal is to get a grade that denotes comprehension of the Learning Goal (which is more or less two thirds of the learning material). Even though a 5.5 (on an scale from 1 – 10) is sufficient to pass to the next Sprint/Period/School Year, that does not by definition indicate comprehension of the Learning Goal. 
The same definition guides the Student Team with planning and decomposing during the Sprint Planning Meeting. The purpose of each Sprint is to accomplish Learning Goals that adhere to the current Definition of “Done” of the Student Team at the highest quality possible.   
Important questions to arrive at a useful Definition of “Done” are:
	How do you check whether you are really done?
	What is done exactly, what criteria should hold?
	But also, when is it not done?

De Student Teams are themselves responsible for setting up their Definition of “Done”. Since setting up a Definition of “Done” is also part of the learning process, it may be changed based on the output of the retrospectives. In that way, new insights can be assimilated into the process to get better results.

<!-- ## The Definition of Fun -->
## 楽しさの定義

An addition to the Definition of “Done” is the Definition of “Fun”. Fun is an important motivator for students and is therefore essential for getting better learning results. Hence, students should also indicate what they need to have fun during the work they are doing. “Need” in this context may be interpreted best in the broad sense of the word: what should be there to ensure enjoyable work. Often the output of a retrospective offers clues for the Definition of “Fun”. The Definition of Fun list is also a ‘living document’ and may be changed or expanded frequently.
